# Project Movies

The aim of the project was to build a multi-page movie site using React Route. We also used styled components, practiced using API's in React combining useState and useEffect. This project was made through pair-programming and made by Madelene Trang and Rebecca Blixt.

## The problem

We had some issues with Live Share extension in Visual Studio Code, which we resolved. We then completed the requirements and added some extra features for the assignment. We are pleased with our end result. If we had more time we would have created a drop-down menu in which we would add more pages to different API endpoints.
